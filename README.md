# Git-and-GitHub
This repository contains the information of Git and GitHub usage. This readme contains the most common Git and GitHub commands used for project management.

## Git
Git is a version control system that keeps track of the changes you made in a specific folder's files (like a history). This specific folder is called a repository. Git works on the your local computer/laptop. Git creates a .git folder that keeps track of all the previous changes. So by using git for your project folder, you can see all the previous changes made, go back to any previous version and much more.

## GitHub
GitHub is an online service where you can store your project folder with the history and share it with anyone. GitHub lets other users access and contribute to your project.

### Git Installation
Download and install Git from [Git site](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Check git install by entering `git --version` on any terminal of your computer. You should get something like `git version 2.45.1.windows.1`. If the terminal cannot recognize the command `git` even after installation, you might need to add the paths of *Git/bin* and *Git/cmd* folders in the environment Variables for Windows Users.
